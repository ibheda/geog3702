<p>I created this map to answer the questions I had about population density in New York. Since the Hudson River is considered to be the heart of New York State, I was interested in how people lived based around the river. Originally I included Downstate New York (Rockland, Westchester, All of NYC, Nassau and Suffok) but these areas were so dense that it made everything else in the region into one catergory. I opted to cut this region out, and still made the data logarithmic to have better visibility. When making this map I had to do a lot of data cleaning as finding population density data for each zip code proved to be quite difficult. I alsp decided to make a reference map in order to better understand the region represented. When looking at this map I was struck by how concentrated the population is into the cities, even without the massive New York City Metro Area. In this map Albany and Poughkeepsie still hold much more density than any other areas.</p>
