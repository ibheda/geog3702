<p>I created this map as I have always loved how national forests have incredible beauty and yet are often overshadowed by the famous National Park System in the United States. This summer I worked in the Salmon Challis National Forest in Idaho and was amazed by it's vastness as well as use for agriculture and recourse around the state. I could not find a map that represented National Forests specifically so I decided to make one myself. I couldn't find a dataset with all of the values I needed so I input them mysled using wikipedia. I found it really interesting how much land in some states is soley devoted to national forests, with Idaho having 39% of it's land just as National Forest land. I also decided to include the National Forests on the map as I thought it would be interesting to show how exactly where they are for some perspective.</p>
